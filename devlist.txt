Support multiple line types, colours, etc. in plot.project
Matlab2R supports reading in multiple matrices
lambda function which can handle multiple matrices (list, array) and can return subdominant eigenvalues
right eigenvector function which can handle multiple matrices (list, array) and can return subdominant eigenvectors
left eigenvector function which can handle multiple matrices (list, array) and can return subdominant eigenvectors
hidden lambda function which works on single matrices
S4 class for projections
Combine documentation for the distance metrics
Give some functions the option to pass a 'projection' object?
More background (simple) functions: e.g. basic projection function

TO DO
