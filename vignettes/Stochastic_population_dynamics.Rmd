We will use a set of matrices for the polar bear *Ursus maritimus*[^1]. The population is found in the southern Beaufort Sea, USA and Canada. There are 6 stages based on age and reproductive status:  
Stage-1: 2-year-old  
Stage 2: 3-year-old  
Stage 3: 4-year-old  
Stage 4: adult (5+ years old), available to breed  
Stage 5: adult, with cub (0-1 years old)  
Stage 6: adult, with yearling (1-2 years old).

Load in the data
```{r}
data(Pbear); Pbear
```

The study also gives the population vector, which is the relative numers of individuals in each stage.
```{r}
Pbearvec <- c(0.106, 0.068, 0.106, 0.461, 0.151, 0.108)
```

The polar bear matrices have a mixed age-stage definition: the stages 1-3 are defined by age, whereas stages 4-6 are defined by a mix of age and reproductive stage. Each matrix describes life cycle transitions in a *specific* year, from 2001-2005. Due to varying environmental conditions (e.g. weather, resource availability), life cycle transitions may change from year to year. For the polar bear, 2004 and 2005 were "bad years" due to low summer sea ice.  

The numbers in the matrix (called ***matrix elements*** or ***transitions***) describe the probability of moving FROM stages in each column TO stages in each row, within the time interval chosen. For example, for the 2005 polar bear matrix, an adult (stage 4) has 7.18% probability of breeding and becoming an adult with a cub (stage 5). Likewise, in any year an adult without a cub has about 72.25% chance of not breeding (therefore remaining in stage 4): this is called a stasis transition. This means that 100 - (72.25 + 7.18) = 20.57% of adults without cubs die every year. Contrast these numbers with "good" years, where reproduction is high and mortality is lower. There are different types of transitions: in this matrix there are also fecundity transitions which describe recruitment of offspring (at an age of 2 years; this is the top-right transition in the matrix). Other species may have different transitions, including skipping stages through fast growth, shrinkage or fission (especially in modular organisms, e.g. most plants, corals), or asexual reproduction.  

Matrix elements combine underlying ***vital rates*** such as survival, growth and reproduction. For example, the stasis transition of adults without cubs (72.25%) combines probability of not breeding successfully, and the probability of surviving the year.

##Stochastic projections

It's a big assumption that over decades, the vital rates of a population won't change. One reason that they may change is because of environmental stochasticity, where environmental conditions, which change from year to year, impact ***vital rates*** such as survival, reproduction and growth. This could be due to many things, such as changes in weather or extreme weather events, disease outbreaks, varying resource availability, changes in predation or parasitism, and so on.  

In the polar bear data, there are 5 matrices from 2001-2005. If you pass the `project` function a single matrix then it does a deterministic projection, but if you pass it a list of matrices as we have for the Polar bear, then it will do a stochastic projection:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
Pbearp1.1 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, time = 50)
plot(Pbearp1.1, log = "y")
```

For a stochastic projection, the `project` function should usually have a list of matrices passed to the `A` argument, and a `vector`. The function will check that all the matrices have the same dimensions. The `time` argument gives the number of projection intervals, but the output will have length `time` + 1, because the population size at time 0 is included.  

By default, the projection selects each matrix with an equal probability at each time interval. This process can be considered a ***Markov process*** with the following transition matrix:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
p1 <- 0.4
( PbearM1 <- matrix(rep(c((1-p1)/3, (1-p1)/3, (1-p1)/3, p1/2, p1/2), 5), 5, 5) )
```

This matrix determines the probability of selecting any matrix at random based on what the previous selection was. It's defined columnwise: at each timestep, the column tells you what the previous selection (at time t) was, and the rows in that column tell you the probability of selecting the next matrix (at time t+1). In this case, all the numbers in the matrix are equal to one another, so there is exactly the same probability of selecting each matrix each time, regardless of what the last selection was.  

We can pass this matrix to the `Aseq` argument of the function to get a new estimate of population dynamics:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
Pbearp2.1 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM1, time = 50)
plot(Pbearp2.1, log = "y")
```

This projection will look different to the last one, because a new random sequence of matrices is generated. However, it is generated from the same set of parameters so overall it should look fairly similar (and later we'll see that it is the same).  

There are situations for some systems where we might want to have unequal probabilities of choosing each matrix (e.g. nonrandom patterns in environmental conditions, behaviour, food availability). In the polar bear data, years '04 and '05 were "bad" years. If bad years occur with probability q, then we can construct a Markov transition matrix incorporating this:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
p2 <- 0.5
( PbearM2 <- matrix(rep(c((1-p2)/3, (1-p2)/3, (1-p2)/3, p2/2, p2/2), 5), 5, 5) )
```

In this case, q = 0.5 means that there is now an equal probability of bad and good years. We can pass this to the `Aseq` argument of the function to get a new estimate of population dynamics:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
Pbearp2.2 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM2, time = 50)
plot(Pbearp2.2, log = "y")
```

This probably doesn't look too much different from the first projection, because in the first projection bad years have a probability of 2/5 = 0.4 chance of being chosen, but in the second they have a probability of 0.5 of being chosen; the two are not very different. With climate change there's a good chance that bad years might become more frequent. What happens if we increase the probability of bad years so that they occur four times as often as good years?
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
p3 <- 0.99
( PbearM3 <- matrix(rep(c((1-p3)/3, (1-p3)/3, (1-p3)/3, p3/2, p3/2), 5), 5, 5) )
Pbearp2.3 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM3, time = 10000)
#plot(Pbearp2.3, log = "y")
length(which(attr(Pbearp2.3,"seq")>3))
```

You should clearly see a steeper decline in population size as the probability of bad years increases.  

At the moment, the probability a matrix is chosen doesn't depend on what the last matrix chosen was: we can tell this because all the columns are the same. The 2004 matrix always has the same probability of being chosen, regardless of whether the last one chosen was 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 or 2005. Imagine, however, that there's positive feedback in the weather systems that determine ice cover, so that good years are more likely to follow good years and bad years are more likely to follow bad years. We can define two parameters now: p, which describes the probability next year is a bad year given that this year was a good year, and q, which is the probability next year is a bad year given that this year was a bad year:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
p4 <- 0.2
q4 <- 0.8
( PbearM4 <- matrix(c(rep(c((1-p4)/3, (1-p4)/3, (1-p4)/3, p4/2, p4/2), 3),
                      rep(c((1-q4)/3, (1-q4)/3, (1-q4)/3, q4/2, q4/2), 2)),
                    5, 5) )
```

The numbers show that if it's a good year (columns 1-3), the probability of next year being bad is low, whereas if it's a bad year (columns 4-5), the probability of next year being bad is high (see rows 4-5 of `PbearM4`). The projection should show us this is true:
```{r}
Pbearp2.4 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM4, time = 50)
plot(Pbearp2.4, log = "y")
```

At the moment, the overall probability of switching between the states is symmetric: 20% chance of switching from bad to good, 20% chance of switching from good to bad. This needn't be the case: perhaps there are stronger positive feedbacks in bad weather conditions than in good. We will increase the probability of switching from good to bad, but keep the probability of switching from bad to good the same:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
p5 <- 0.9
q5 <- 0.99
( PbearM5 <- matrix(c(rep(c((1-p5)/3, (1-p5)/3, (1-p5)/3, p5/2, p5/2), 3),
                      rep(c((1-q5)/3, (1-q5)/3, (1-q5)/3, q5/2, q5/2), 2)),
                    5, 5) )
Pbearp2.5 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM5, time = 50)
plot(Pbearp2.5, log = "y")
```

Finally, imagine that the weather is cyclic and the conditions always appear in 5-year cycles, in the order in which they were observed. In this case, there's a 100% chance of moving from 2001 conditions to 2002 conditions, the same for 2002 to 2003, and so on, until the 5-year cycle completes and conditions move from 2005 conditions back to 2001 again:
```{r comment = "   ", collapse=TRUE}
( PbearM6 <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1,
                      1, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                      0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
                      0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
                      0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
                    5, 5, byrow = TRUE) )
Pbearp2.6 <- project(Pbear, Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM6, time = 50)
plot(Pbearp2.6, log = "y")
```

We can still see the deline in overall population size, but with a clear cyclic dynamic to the trend.

*Extras: the type of population projection we've done is called **matrix selection**: at each timestep a matrix is selected at random from a list. These are usually parameterised by collecting data under multiple different environmental conditions (these are often replications through time, but may also be replications through space or different experimental treatments). Another common form of stochastic projection is using **element selection**. In this case, one or more of the matrix elements are selected at random from a statistical distribution.*  

*Element selection is possible in `popdemo` by generating a list of matrices using element selection procedures and passing these to `project`. In this example, we'll use a matrix for the thistle Carlina vulgaris[^1]. There are 3 stages based on size and reproductive status:*  
*small rosette*  
*large rosette*  
*large flowering rosette*
```{r}
( Thistle <- Matlab2R("[0.5 0 2.8; 0.25 0.222 0; 0 0.667 0]") )
#we'll use a random vector for the models
Thistlevec <- runif(3); Thistlevec <- Thistlevec / sum(Thistlevec)
```

*Let's imagine that the probability an individual flowers in any given year is normally distributed around 0.667, with a variance of 0.05. We can:*  
*- generate random normal draws with a mean of 0.667 and a variance of 0.07 (this must be truncated so that no value is higher than 1 and no value is lower than 0, although with this mean and this variance that's unlikely)*  
*- create a list of 30 matrices*  
*- replace the [3,2] element of each one with our randomly drawn numbers*
```{r}
#generate normally-distributed random probability of flowering
times <- 30
flwrMean <- 0.667
flwrVar <- 0.07
rflwr <- rnorm(times, flwrMean, flwrVar)
rflwr[rflwr >= 1] <- 0.999 #reassign any values >1
rflwr[rflwr <= 0] <- 0.001 #reassign any values <0
#create list of 30 matrices
ThistleS <- rep(list(Thistle), 30)
#replace [3,2] element of every matrix with new random number
ThistleS <- mapply(function(A, r){A[3,2] <- r; A}, ThistleS, rflwr, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
```

*It's possible to force `project` to use a specific sequence of matrices, simply by passing a sequence of numbers or names to `Aseq`. These numbers or names must correspond to the elements of your list of matrices (so for the final projection of the polar bear model we could have instead specified c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3,...) or c("2001", "2002", "2003", "2004", "2005", "2001", "2002", "2003",...) ). For this exercise in element selection, all we need to do is pass 1:30 to `Aseq`:*
```{r}
Thistlep1.1 <- project(ThistleS, vector = Thistlevec, Aseq = 1:30)
plot(Thistlep1.1, log = "y")
lines(0:30, project(Thistle, Thistlevec, time = 30), lty = 3)
```

*The dotted line shows the deterministc projection for comparison. The stochastic projection should look similar, but with variation in the timestep-by-timestep growth.*  

*The underlying biology should drive decisions about how to sample transitions in element selection. For example:*  
*- Something like a Gamma distribution could be used to model fecundity transitions, as these should be truncated at 0 and $+\infty$*  
*- More than one distribution can model a certain type of transition; for example, survival probabilities with wide variances may be better drawn from something other than the normal distribution (e.g. beta).*  
*- Transitions are composed of underlying vital rates and they may correlate with one another, so it may be important to model stochasticity in underlying vital rates and contruct matrices from these.*

#Stochastic dynamics

Stochastic projections are a random process. Perhaps the best way to understand stochastic population growth is to project the model and calculate growth from the results. We can calculate long-term growth of a stochastic model by averaging per-timestep growth rates over a long projection time. Every stochastic projection has a mean growth and a variance in growth. Let's calculate stochastic dynamics for the six Polar bear examples above:


:
```{r}
stoch(Pbear, c("lambda", "var"), vector = Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM1)

stoch(Pbear, c("lambda", "var"), vector = Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM2)

stoch(Pbear, c("lambda", "var"), vector = Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM3)

stoch(Pbear, c("lambda", "var"), vector = Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM4)

stoch(Pbear, c("lambda", "var"), vector = Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM5)

stoch(Pbear, c("lambda", "var"), vector = Pbearvec, Aseq = PbearM6)

```
\  

*Extras: the sequence of matrices can affect what the growth of a stochastic model is. What happens if you increase the likelihood of a bad year in the example above? What about directionality of transition probability: it's possible, for example, to make moving into a bad year cycle from a good year cycle more likely than moving into a good year cycle from a bad year cycle.*
