CHANGELOG
Version 1.3-0  Added S4 class, methods and generics for projections. This does
               everything the S3 classes used to do, and more, but with a 
               stricter and more accessible structure. See ?Projection-class
               for methods for handling the new classes and ?Projection-plot
               for display and plot methods.
               Changes to 'project' function: 
               - removed dependency on markovchain
                 package and added a bespoke markov chain simulation function 
                 (.rmc) to handle that (thanks to Steve Ellner).
               - Changes to output new S4 Projection object
               Added a package Vignette which runs through (most) of the 
               functionality of the package. See browseVignettes("popdemo")
               - new Polar bear data included for stochastics examples
               - updates to documentation to keep pace with CRAN
Version 1.2-1  Bug fix ('project' function markov chain simulation not working)
Version 1.2-0  Added functionality to 'project' function to perform stochastic
               projections
               Added 'eigs' function for calculating dominant eigendata
               Added 'stoch' function for calculating stochastic growth
               parameters (mean / variance)
Version 1.1-1  - Bug fixes to S3 plot method for projections: now fully 
                 supports user-defined parameters, e.g. points instead of 
                 lines, colours, log axes, and more (without returning 
                 warnings).
               - Fixed bugs which caused certain S3 methods to not register
                 properly.
               - Fixed a bug which meant not all deprecated functions
                 were registering properly. Now all older versions of 
                 functions will work (with a warning to redirect to the
                 new function).
               - Added support for simultaneously projecting multiple
                 user-specified population vectors, with plotting support.
               - Small changes to documentation
Version 1.1-0  Updates to 'project' function and its S3 method to 
               facilitate projection of dirichlet draws of population 
               structures.
Version 1.0-0: 'devtools' now used to check and build the package.
               Changes to documentation, renaming of lots of functions.
               DOCUMENTATION
               Big changes to documentation.
               1. Move to 'devtools' means the package source 
                  now uses 'roxygen2' for documentation.
               2. Updates to contents of nearly all documentation 
                  files for better clarity and updated nomenclature.
               3. Links between documentation now handled
                  mostly by function families.
               4. Merging of documentation for some S3 plot methods.
               FUNCTIONS 
               1. Deprecated functions
                  Many functions in popdemo have been renamed
                  in version 1.0-0. The old names are now deprecated.
                  The old names will work for now, but may be removed
                  completely in future versions! Most of the changes 
                  are to remove periods from function names: in previous 
                  versions the use of periods in names gave rise to 
                  the possibility for confusion between functions and 
                  S3 methods. The renamed functions are:
                    'Cohen.cumulative'           now 'CohenD'
                    'convergence.time'           now 'convt'
                    'inertia.tfa'                now 'tfa_inertia'
                    'inertia.tfamatrix'          now 'tfam_inertia'
                    'inertia.tfsens'             now 'tfs_inertia'
                    'inertia.tfsensmatrix'       now 'tfsm_inertia'
                    'is.matrix_ergodic'          now 'isErgodic'
                    'is.matrix_irreducible'      now 'isIrreducible'
                    'is.matrix_primitive'        now 'isPrimitive'
                    'Keyfitz.delta'              now 'KeyfitzD'
                    'projection.distance'        now 'projectionD'
                  Other functions have been renamed to keep consistency
                  with new functions, and also to further avoid problems
                  with S3 methods by making sure functions and classes 
                  don't have the same name:
                    'tfa'                        now 'tfa_lambda'
                    'tfamatrix'                  now 'tfam_lambda'
                    'tfsens                      now 'tfs_lambda
                    'tfsensmatrix'               now 'tfsm_lambda'
                  Some functions have been made internal, as
                  they were only ever intended to be used by
                  other popdemo functions:
                    'tf'                         now '.tf'
                    'minCS'                      now '.minCS'
                  Two functions have been merged:
                    'reactivity','firststepatt'  now 'reac'
               2. New functions
                  'reac' replaces 'reactivity' and 'firststepatt'.
Version 0.2-3: Further changes to DESCRIPTION file to keep
               CRAN happy
Version 0.2-2: Changed title and description fields in
               DESCRIPTION file to align more closely with
               CRAN guidelines
Version 0.2-1: Fixed bug in sens and elas functions where 
               complex conjugates of left eigenvector were 
               not properly calculated, which would have 
               resulted in incorrect sensitivity and 
               elasticity calculations for eigenvalues with 
               nonzero imaginary components in version 0.1-4 
               and earlier. This does not affect results for 
               sensitivity and elasticity analyses of the 
               dominant eigenvalue of irreducible matrices 
               (i.e. sensitivity and elasticity of asymptotic 
               population growth in ergodic models).
Version 0.1-4: Fixed maintainer email address
Version 0.1-3: Tortoise matrix included as data
Version 0.1-2: Bugs in demos sorted.
