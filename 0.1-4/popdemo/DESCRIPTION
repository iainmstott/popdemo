Description: popdemo provides a set of tools designed for modelling population
    demography using population projection matrix (PPM) models. The focus is mainly
    on indices of transient dynamics, and the use of control theory (specifically
    transfer functions). However, popdemo includes a number of tools focussing on
    other areas of demographic modelling. Some tools may prove useful to anyone
    working with projection matrix models of any type, or indeed matrices in
    general. The package is designed to build on those tools already available in
    popbio.
