Version 0.1-2: Bugs in demos sorted.
Version 0.1-3: Tortoise matrix included as data
Version 0.1-4: Fixed maintainer email address
Version 0.2-1: Fixed bug in sens and elas functions where 
               complex conjugates of left eigenvector were 
               not properly calculated, which would have 
               resulted in incorrect sensitivity and 
               elasticity calculations for eigenvalues with 
               nonzero imaginary components in version 0.1-4 
               and earlier. This does not affect results for 
               sensitivity and elasticity analyses of the 
               dominant eigenvalue of irreducible matrices 
               (i.e. sensitivity and elasticity of asymptotic 
               population growth in ergodic models).
Version 0.2-3: Added namespace of Matrix to imports, to
               facilitate working with sparseMatrices and other
               matrix classes
